# Control Voltage Standards

The Control Voltage Standards is a module for providing precise voltages. This module is enabled by a whole bunch of potentiometers.

The circuit here is based on the [CV Standards](https://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/STANDARDS/index.html) with minor tweaks to make it more Eurorack friendly. The changes I've made are thus:
* Selected resistors appropriate for +/-12V rails,
* Added polarity protection so that a backward power header doesn't fry anything (twin series schotty diodes: BAT54SL),
* Full surface mount design.

The Yusynth page is a treasure trove of information about this circuit that I am too amateur to claim as my own; please read that outstanding page before using this circuit. The page provides many details and other implementations of this circuit that you may find suitable.

The KiCAD project here uses the library/footprints [found in my companion repo](https://github.com/thismatters/EurorackKiCAD).

## Width

4hp on a standard 3U rack.

## Inputs

Twin 12 position switches which allow selection of `octave` and `semitone`. A jack allows input of control voltage to offset the selected tone.

## Outputs

Three buffered jacks output control voltage.

## Adjustment

Oh boy. TODO

## Vendors

There are part numbers in the [BOM](cv-standard.csv) for many of the parts (not for basic passives though) at the following vendors:

* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com): Needs no introduction. Get your ICs from here (or [digikey](https://www.digikey.com)).
* [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/): Good supplier for passive components; audio jacks, and potentiometers. Their audio jacks are slightly smaller than the thonkiconn from thonk.
* [Love My Switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/): Has [really good knobs](https://lovemyswitches.com/anodized-aluminum-knob-the-lo-fi-1-4-smooth-shaft-12-5mm-od/) to go on those potentiometers!
* [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/): Fast and (relatively) cheap PCB manufacturer. I haven't done a prototype run yet... stay tuned.
